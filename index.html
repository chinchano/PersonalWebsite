        <h2>Climbable Mountain </h2>
        <p>I got into software development mainly from curiosity. Quickly, that curiosity turned into an obsession with learning something new as often as I could. A lack of a Computer Science degree or any background of such before I started learning gives me enough motivation to become an absolute rock star with programming.</p>

        <h2>Familiar Process</h2>
        <p>I feel that learning software language is the same process as when I learned fluent Spanish and how to play bass guitar. The more you're exposed to it and the more you use it, the faster you improve. The more mistakes I make, the more opportunity I have to be corrected and improve. </p>

        <h2>Fun Lifestyle</h2>
        <p>The thing I like most about the software industry is it's impossible to get bored. Changes and improvements are always being made. Working in an industry that never sleeps is a set up for life long challenges. New framework updates, language updates, gem updates...how can you get bored with that?</p>

        <h2><a href="PasswordValidation/index.html">Password Validation Form</a></h2>
        <p>This is a password validation page I am building using jQuery for the behavior side of the project. Some CSS styling used for the input boxes and to make the submit button look presentable. Currently, I'm at the stage where the warning boxes remove once the correct amount of characters are entered using "keyup" and "focus" from the jQuery library. The Submit button will not work if a username isn't entered as well. Now, I'm working on having an alert pop up to the user when something from the form is missing.</p><h5> Technologies used-jQuery, HTML5, CSS3</h5>

        <h2><a href="Clock/index.html">Digital Alarm Clock</a></h2>
        <p>This project I'm pretty proud of. I learned a lot about the functions that are already available with Javascript. I never knew about the Date() function. Using that function I was able to create variables for hours, minutes and seconds. Using those variables I was able to construct a string that resembles a digital clock. I also leared about the setInterval() function when I couldn't figure out why the clock wouldn't tick. Now I'm working on an alarm function that is fired when the submit button I created is pressed</p><h5> Technologies used-Javascript, HTML5, CSS3</h5>

        <h2><a href="Feed/index.html">Flickr Photo Feed</a></h2>
        <p>I built this project with a close friend of mine to get more familiar with using jQuery and Ajax together. Also, I had some good practicing understanding how third party API's operate. Some are easier to use than others and Flickr fits that category. Learning about parsing JSON so the data can be easily used was also pretty interesting. The next stage for this project is to get better search results and no duplicate pictures.</p><h5> Technologies used-jQuery, AJAX, Flickr API, HTML5, CSS3</h5>
